1. Directive
  Is a special token, in the markup, that tells the library VueJS to to do something to a DOM element.

2. v-if directive
  - we can bind to a property to show or not a piece of code
  - with this directive the code will disappear totally if is not showed, so removes elements from DOM,
    including the nested elements
  
3. Keeping track in v-for 
  - we can keep track of an element that we add in an array by adding a :key="ingredient" in 
    <li v-for="(ingredient, index) in ingredients" :key="ingredient">

    because ingredient is unique
